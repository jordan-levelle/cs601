                    <p class="homeText">
                        My name is Jordan. A little about me. I am a Marine Corps Veteran having served 4 years as a 
                        musician (drummer) as well as being the audio engineer for the unit I was 
                        stationed with. After the military I pursued an MA in Music Industry Leadership 
                        at Northeastern. I graduated in 2020 and with the pandemic in full swing at 
                        that time I decided to transition to a different area of learning and here we are. 
                        I have enjoyed the MA Computer Science program at BU so far and definitely 
                        ready to get out in to the field when my time at BU comes to an end.

            <h4>Purpose of this Site</h4>
            <p class="homeText">
                The purpose of this site is to display a series of current events regarding the music industry. It is also consists of a series of instructional lessons on various musical areas. 
                As the site develops more relaetd areas will be added. There also may be be some removing of content that doesn't fit well with the overall goal of the site. 
                My hope is to develop this into a semi personal blog as well as news feed regarding the world of perucssion and drums.
